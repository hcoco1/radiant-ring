**Career Simulation 2**



In this career simulation, you will use your newfound knowledge of the Windows operating system and management techniques to solve a problem. This scenario is based on a real-life simulation using a fictional company and team members. Using techniques learned in this bootcamp, you will examine and explain which tools to use for the best possible outcomes. Additionally, you will write a runbook to document your findings.



## Scenario

>As a new StackFull Software employee, you've been tasked to work alongside Damen, the IT Security Manager, to write a runbook for the IT Pre-onboarding process.
IT onboarding introduces and trains new hires in the technology they'll use in their day-to-day responsibilities. Before onboarding begins, however, the IT team needs to set up and ensure new hire technology is ready for their first day.
A runbook is a detailed "how-to" guide for completing a commonly repeated task or procedure within a company's IT operations process, like setting up a laptop for a new hire.
You have the unique experience of participating in IT onboarding and knowledge of Windows management that can help with this task! Complete each of the steps below using the server and DESKTOP-2 in your Unit 5: Windows VM, then write a runbook to complete the steps for all new hires moving forward.


## Runbook
Damen would like you to write a runbook documenting your process for setting up a machine for new hires. Your runbook should include the following:

- Introduction of what steps the runbook achieves
- Procedure on how to complete steps, with visuals
